# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.8.1

- Added PTY-mode awareness to `ClaudeAdapter`. New `PTY bool` field plus `NewClaudeAdapterPTY()` and `NewClaudeAdapterDevPTY()` constructors. When `PTY=true`, `BuildArgs` emits interactive-shape args: it omits `-p`, `--print`, `--output-format`, `--verbose`, and `--system-prompt`, and ignores both the `prompt` and `systemPrompt` parameters. Optional `--resume <id>` is included when `cliSessionID != ""`, and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is included when `SkipPermissions` is set. Subprocess-per-turn callers (`NewClaudeAdapter()` / `NewClaudeAdapterDev()`) see byte-for-byte unchanged behavior.
- Surfaced by clockwork-manifold S2.5 plan-execute smoke retry on 2026-05-08: `go-agent-sessions/agentsessions/pty_session.go` calls `BuildArgs("", systemPrompt, sessionIDPreset)` for the initial PTY spawn, so the previous always-print-mode args caused claude to exit immediately with `Error: Input must be provided either through stdin or as a prompt argument when using --print`. Per-turn payloads in PTY mode arrive via PTY stdin (the lib's `BootMode=stdin` mechanism), and system prompts route via `BootPrompt` rather than `--system-prompt`.
- Tests: PTY-mode arg-shape unit tests cover empty, skip-permissions, resume, resume+skip-permissions, and prompt/systemPrompt-ignored cases, plus a negative check that none of `-p` / `--print` / `--system-prompt` / `--output-format` / `--verbose` appear in PTY-mode argv. Pre-existing print-mode tests pass unchanged. A real-spawn smoke test (`TestClaudeAdapter_PTYSpawn_Smoke`, `provider/pty_claude_smoke_test.go`) is gated on `CLAUDE_PTY_SMOKE=1` and asserts the process survives 1s without dying on arg validation; it skips when the `claude` binary is not on PATH so CI doesn't auto-run it. `go test -race -count=1 ./...` clean on darwin; `GOOS=linux go build/vet ./...` clean.

### Compatibility

- Additive only. Existing callers of `NewClaudeAdapter()` / `NewClaudeAdapterDev()` are unaffected — they remain print-mode and produce identical args.
- The `CLIAdapter.BuildArgs` interface signature is unchanged.

### Consumer follow-ups (not landing here)

- `clockwork-manifold` (CW-20260508-0005): branch the adapter factory in `internal/runtime/agent/factory.go` on PTY caps to call the new `*PTY` constructors; revert the `pty: false` workaround on the 5 claude profiles in `profiles.yaml`.
- `agent-mux`: future migration from internal `claudecode` runtime to this adapter (tracked separately).
- PTY adapters for `codex` / `opencode` / `gemini` / `copilot` / `aider` / `junie` / `kiro` / `qwen`: each has its own interactive-mode question; not in scope here.

## v0.8.0

- Added per-line typed event taxonomy at `provider/events/` (`events.Event` interface with concrete types `Delta`, `ToolUse`, `ToolResult`, `Thinking`, `Usage`, `Done`, `Error`, `SessionID`, `SubagentSpawn`, `SubprocessStderr`, `Heartbeat`). Apps wire a callback into the spawn context via `WithEvents(ctx, cb)`; the PTYBridge / SubprocessBridge fires typed events alongside the existing `StreamEvent` channel returned by `Provider.StreamChat`. The legacy channel is unchanged; the typed surface is purely additive.
- Adapters can opt into native typed parsing via the new `EventParser` optional interface (`ParseLineEvents(line []byte) ([]events.Event, error)`). `ClaudeAdapter` and `CodexAdapter` implement it; the claude path additionally captures user-role `tool_result` blocks as `events.ToolResult` (previously dropped at the legacy `StreamEvent` layer) and emits `events.SubagentSpawn` for the `Task` tool. Adapters that don't implement `EventParser` fall back to a best-effort `StreamEvent` → typed translation via `translateStreamEvents`.
- Added `WithToolArgFingerprint(ctx, true)` opt-in privacy mode. When set, typed `events.ToolUse.Args` (and `events.SubagentSpawn.Args`) values are replaced with `sha256:<hex>` digests of their JSON-marshalled form; argument keys are preserved and `Fingerprint=true` is set on the event. Default off — full args are emitted, matching v0.7.0 behavior. Use this when logs may cross trust boundaries.
- Added `events.SubprocessStderr` for subprocess-transport stderr capture. SubprocessBridge wires `cmd.StderrPipe()` only when `WithEvents` is set; without a callback, stderr stays at its default destination (Go's exec default of `/dev/null`). PTYBridge does not emit `SubprocessStderr` because PTYs merge stderr into the tty stream at the kernel level.
- Added `events.Heartbeat` synthesized by the bridge on a configurable interval when no other typed event has fired in that window. Default interval is `DefaultHeartbeatInterval` (5s); apps can adjust via `WithHeartbeatInterval(ctx, d)` (`d <= 0` disables). Useful for "agent is alive but idle" UX indicators.
- Added `BootDirSpec()` per adapter via the new optional `BootDirProvider` interface. Each adapter exposes its per-task tempdir layout convention as read-only metadata: `PlantedFiles` (relative paths + render closures), `EnvAmendments` (with `{{.BootDir}}` / `{{.ProjectDir}}` placeholders for app-side substitution), `CwdPreference` (boot dir vs. project dir), `ProjectDirArg` (e.g. `--add-dir {{.ProjectDir}}`). Concrete specs landed for claude (`CLAUDE.md` + `boot.md` + `.claude/settings.json` + `.mcp.json`, cwd = bootDir, `--add-dir`), codex (`AGENTS.md` + `boot.md` + `.mcp.json`, cwd = bootDir, `--cd` — verify against installed codex), opencode (`agents/<name>.md` + `agents.json` + `opencode.json` + `boot.md` + `.mcp.json`, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR={{.BootDir}}`, cwd = projectDir, `--dir`). Stub specs (zero-value + non-empty `Notes`) for gemini, copilot, aider, junie, kiro, qwen — the convention probe is filed as a follow-up.
- Added `AgentsMD(agent AgentInfo, mcpLoopbackURL, extras...)` shared helper that renders an `AGENTS.md` document with frontmatter (name/role/description), an H1 title, the system prompt body, and an optional "## MCP" section. Used by the codex `BootDirSpec.AGENTS.md` `PlantedFile.Render` closure by default; apps that want a custom layout can ignore it and render their own content.
- Preserved the no-silent-drop guard at `pty.go` / `subprocess.go` (`"CLI bridge cannot forward tool calls"` when only tool_use blocks arrive without text deltas) and mirrored it to the typed-events callback so consumers wired into `WithEvents` see the same sentinel as `events.Error`.
- Tests: per-adapter `ParseLineEvents` fixtures, every `BootDirSpec` planted-file render, end-to-end PTY spawn of a fake claude shell script with `WithEvents` callback assertion, fingerprint-mode SHA-256 digest verification, backward-compat snapshot showing v0.7.0 semantics preserved when `WithEvents` is not set. `go test -race -count=1 ./...` clean on darwin; `GOOS=linux go build/vet ./...` clean.

### Compatibility

- The four capabilities are entirely additive. Callers that don't import `provider/events` and don't call `WithEvents` / `WithToolArgFingerprint` / `BootDirSpec` see no behavior change vs. v0.7.0. Existing `Provider`, `ProviderWithUsage`, `CLIAdapter`, and `EventReactionPipeline` consumers are unaffected.
- The new typed-event taxonomy lives at `provider/events/` to avoid colliding with the existing `EventType` string constants (`EventDelta`, `EventToolUse`, …) in `provider/provider.go`. Both surfaces remain valid; consumers picking up typed events import the sub-package.
- `BootDirProvider` is a runtime type-assertion — apps must check `if bp, ok := adapter.(BootDirProvider); ok` and inspect `Notes` before iterating `PlantedFiles` for stub-spec adapters.

### Out of scope (filed as portfolio follow-ups)

- Probing `BootDirSpec` for gemini / copilot / aider / junie / kiro / qwen against installed CLI versions.
- Verifying the codex `--cd` flag and MCP config convention against the installed codex revision (Notes flag this).
- Verifying opencode's MCP config convention.
- Adding `events.Thinking` emission from the claude PTY adapter — the CLI's stream-json doesn't currently surface thinking blocks at the assistant level; the existing `StreamEvent.EventThinking` is from the Anthropic HTTP adapter. When the claude CLI exposes them, ParseLineEvents will fold them in.
- Updating consumer apps' `go.mod` to v0.8.0 — separate per-app work in nanite, agent-mux, clockwork-manifold.

## v0.7.0

- Added `Cacheable` optional interface (`EstimateCacheablePrefix(ctx, req) int`) for pre-flight cacheable-prefix observability. Implemented by `*Anthropic` via a shared `buildRequestBody` helper that marshals the same payload the wire request would carry, divided by 4 for the token approximation. Callers type-assert; providers without prompt caching do not implement it.
- Added `RateLimited` optional interface (`RateLimitTPM() int`) for input-tokens-per-minute observability. Implemented by `*Anthropic`. Returns `0` when no calibration has happened yet — the contract requires implementations to treat the seeded default as "unknown" rather than surfacing it as an observed value.
- Flipped `ToolDefinition.Strict` default. Previously `nil` meant strict-on by default on the Anthropic adapter; now `nil` is non-strict and callers must explicitly set `Strict` to a pointer to `true` to opt in. Rationale: strict was being applied blanket-fashion across all tools, conflating input-shape validation (where strict adds value) with high-blast-radius permission concerns (which belong at project/session/agent-profile scope).
- Anthropic non-streaming `Complete`/`CompleteWithUsage` now honor `ChatRequest.MaxTokens`. Historical hardcoded cap was 128 tokens, which silently truncated longer completions; the default now mirrors streaming at 16384 when callers leave `MaxTokens` unset.
- Anthropic rate-budget pre-flight is now cache-aware: estimates subtract the cacheable-prefix bytes so requests with healthy cache hits don't trip `ErrRequestExceedsRateBudget` unnecessarily. Default rate-tracker seed raised from 30,000 to 50,000 TPM. The seed is overridable via the `ANTHROPIC_RATE_LIMIT_TPM` env var for callers on higher tiers.
- Tightened the cache-marker heuristic to match `"cache_control":{` (key + colon + opening brace) rather than the bare `"cache_control"` token. Prevents false positives from user content or tool-schema strings that contain the literal substring `cache_control` and would otherwise produce a spurious cacheable-prefix offset.
- Added structured `slog` logging on rate-limit calibration. Logs only on first calibration or real tier transitions; same-value re-calibrations are silent so the signal stays meaningful.
- Added regression tests: cache-marker false-positive guard, `RateLimitTPM` returns 0 pre-calibration and the header value post-calibration, `CompleteWithUsage` default `max_tokens=16384` and caller-supplied `MaxTokens` forwarding.
- Doc updates: `ChatRequest.MaxTokens` flagged as Anthropic-only today (OpenAI/Azure/Gemini/Mistral/Ollama/OpenRouter/OpenZen/PTY adapters silently ignore it pending future passthrough work); `ToolDefinition.Strict` documents the breaking-default change with rationale; `RateLimited.RateLimitTPM` doc tightened to require pre-calibration `0`.

### Compatibility

- `ToolDefinition.Strict` default change is the only behavior-breaking item. Callers that relied on `nil`-as-strict-on must set `Strict: &true` per tool where Anthropic's server-side schema enforcement is wanted.
- `Cacheable` and `RateLimited` are additive optional interfaces. Existing `Provider` callers are unaffected; new callers type-assert when they want the observability hooks.
- `RateLimitTPM` returning `0` pre-calibration is a new contract — telemetry callers should treat `0` as "unknown" and skip emitting the limit field rather than reporting a guess.

## v0.5.1

- Added Anthropic interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14 support: new `ReasoningConfig` (with `Enabled`, `BudgetTokens`, `BetasHeader`) plumbed via `WithReasoningConfig` / `ReasoningConfigFromContext`. The Anthropic adapter sends the `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header and `thinking_config` request parameter as a pair, gated on `BudgetTokens > 0` AND a supported model.
- Added `EventThinking` stream event and `ThinkingBlock` payload (`Thinking` text + cryptographic `Signature`). The Anthropic adapter parses `thinking_delta` + `signature_delta` SSE blocks and emits a complete `EventThinking` on `content_block_stop`. Signatures must round-trip verbatim on subsequent turns; assistant-message marshaling preserves them via the new `Signature` field on `ContentBlock`.
- Added `modelSupportsInterleavedThinking` feature detection. Accepts the canonical `claude-{opus|sonnet|haiku}-4[-<minor>]-<YYYYMMDD>` shape and requires the trailing date ≥ `20250514` (`minInterleavedThinkingModelDate`). Structured matching avoids `strings.Contains` false positives like `claude-opus-40-*`.
- Fixed `marshalMessagesWithCacheCount` cache_control handling for messages ending with a thinking block (e.g. `[text, thinking]`). Previously, cache_control was skipped entirely when the last block was thinking; now `lastNonThinkingIdx` is computed and cache_control attaches to the last non-thinking block.
- Tightened the interleaved-thinking gate: `Enabled=true` with `BudgetTokens=0` no longer sends the beta header (which would have been a silent no-op without `thinking_config`). Extracted as `shouldEnableInterleavedThinking` helper. `ReasoningConfig.BudgetTokens` doc updated to require `> 0` for reasoning to actually be requested.
- Added regression tests: model-detection boundaries (false-prefix, pre-min-date, year-mismatch, non-numeric-minor, trailing-garbage); gate combinations (full enable, BudgetTokens=0, Enabled=false, missing/wrong header, unsupported model); cache_control with `[text, thinking]`, `[thinking, text]`, all-thinking, and cached-multi-block shapes; SSE thinking-delta accumulation + disabled-path no-op; thinking-block round-trip serialization.

### Compatibility

- `ContentBlock` gains a `Signature` field (only set on `type="thinking"` blocks). Existing callers of `ContentBlock` that don't construct thinking blocks are unaffected.
- `StreamEvent` gains a `ThinkingBlock` field; existing event consumers that switch on `Type` can ignore `EventThinking` until they're ready to consume thinking deltas.

## v0.5.0

- Introduced distinct named type `EventType` with canonical constants (`EventDelta`, `EventToolUse`, `EventUsage`, `EventError`, `EventDone`, `EventSessionID`); `StreamEvent.Type` is now compiler-enforced and consumers should use the named constants instead of string literals.
- Added free helper `IsTurnComplete(ev StreamEvent) bool` for terminal-event detection — universal across all CLI adapters; no `CLIAdapter` interface change.
- Both `PTYBridge` and `SubprocessBridge` now guarantee exactly one terminal event before channel close (adapter passthrough → ctx-cancel error → non-zero-exit error → synthetic `EventDone` on clean exit). The no-silent-drop guard's `EventError` now **replaces** the adapter's `EventDone` rather than preceding it, restoring the "either is terminal" contract.
- Added grace-period termination via `cmd.Cancel = SIGTERM` + `cmd.WaitDelay` in both spawn paths, replacing the manual goroutine race in `PTYBridge.killProcess` (removed) and the bare `cmd.Process.Kill()` in `SubprocessBridge`. Configurable via new `WithWaitDelay(ctx, d)` / `WaitDelayFromContext(ctx)` context helpers; `DefaultWaitDelay = 5 * time.Second`.
- Added per-adapter docstrings documenting turn-boundary semantics across Claude / Qwen / Gemini / Junie / Codex / Aider / Kiro / Copilot.
- Fixed `Gemini.readSSE` emitting `EventDone` then potentially `EventError`; now emits exactly one terminal event ordered correctly.
- Added regression tests: per-adapter golden-line `IsTurnComplete` fixtures (with explicit Copilot EOF outlier subtest), `EventType` constant-pinning, SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL ordering with explicit lower-bound + upper-bound timing assertions, synthetic-`EventDone`-on-clean-exit.

### Compatibility

- `StreamEvent.Type` changes from `string` to a distinct named `EventType`. Existing untyped string-literal comparisons (e.g. `ev.Type == "delta"`) still compile because Go's untyped-constant assignability rules permit it, but new code should use the named constants for compiler-enforced safety.
- The bridge terminal-event guarantee is a new contract: consumers can rely on the channel-final event being turn-terminal (`IsTurnComplete(ev) == true`). Callers that previously inspected exit codes separately to detect turn boundaries can simplify.
- Removed `PTYBridge.killProcess` (was internal). The grace-period behavior it implemented is now stdlib-driven via `cmd.Cancel` + `cmd.WaitDelay`.

## v0.4.0

- Added optional `ProviderWithUsage.CompleteWithUsage(ctx, req) (CompleteResult, error)` and `CompleteResult` so non-streaming completions can return token usage while preserving the existing `Provider` interface and `Complete()` call sites.
- Updated Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, OpenRouter, OpenZen, Ollama, subprocess, PTY, and event-pipeline adapters to preserve non-streaming usage metadata.
- Standardized the package documentation, added a local Anthropic tracing helper, removed the out-of-tree `replace` directive, added an MIT `LICENSE`, and added runnable examples.

## v0.1.0

- Added `Registry.Unregister(name) bool` to support plugin hot-unload.
- `Registry` is now safe for concurrent use (internal `sync.RWMutex`).
