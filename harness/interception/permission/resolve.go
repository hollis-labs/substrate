// resolve.go implements workspace-relative permission pattern resolution.
//
// Permission Rule.Pattern fields may use the `./` prefix to mean "relative to
// the session's working_dir". At session start (or profile-load time) the
// rule set is resolved against the concrete working_dir, yielding a new rule
// set whose `./`-prefixed patterns have been canonicalized to absolute paths.
// Patterns without the `./` prefix pass through unchanged (back-compat with
// absolute patterns and with non-path patterns such as shell-command
// substrings like `rm -rf`).
//
// Sharp edges enforced here:
//
//   - `./..` and any other traversal that would escape the working_dir is
//     rejected at resolution time. The whole RuleSet.Resolve call errors out
//     so the caller sees the misconfiguration loudly instead of silently
//     widening the agent's reach.
//
//   - Symlinks in the working_dir prefix are resolved to canonical paths via
//     filepath.EvalSymlinks. This closes the symlink-based scope-escape vector
//     (a working_dir symlinked into /etc/ would otherwise let a `./**` grant
//     reach /etc/**). When the working_dir does NOT exist on disk yet, we
//     fall back to filepath.Abs + filepath.Clean rather than failing — tests
//     and forward-looking config tooling need to be able to resolve patterns
//     against not-yet-materialized directories.
//
//   - The glob suffix on the input pattern (`./**`, `./generated/**`,
//     `./generated/foo.go`) is preserved verbatim after substitution. Glob
//     matching is the consumer's job; this resolver only handles the prefix
//     swap + traversal/symlink hardening.
//
// Downstream consumers of the resolved patterns:
//
//   - The summary sub-package renders the resolved absolute paths so an agent
//     reads concrete paths rather than `./` shapes.
//
//   - DeriveSubagentRuleSet forwards parent denies, including resolved `./`
//     patterns, into spawned children in their canonical absolute form.
//     Children inherit the same resolved surface their parent operates
//     against, not the un-resolved literal.
